Re-creating Colin Woodard's American Nations Maps

I find Colin Woodard's _American Nations_ categorization of 11 subgroups making up the American polity fascinating. Inspired by a post on [OpenData Stack Exchange](https://opendata.stackexchange.com/questions/17634/county-list-of-woodards-american-nations) I wondered if the data shared there could be verified for accuracy and joined with other open source data.
